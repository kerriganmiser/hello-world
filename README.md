Hello!

I am a student in my third year at Ball State where I am studying Actuarial Science.  For summer 2017, I will be working with Humana as an Actuarial intern in Louisvile, KY.  This year I have become part of the executivve board of Gamma Iota Sigma, where I will be responsible for recruitng new members.  In my spare time, I work at Ulta, enjoy hanging out with my friends, and watching tv.
